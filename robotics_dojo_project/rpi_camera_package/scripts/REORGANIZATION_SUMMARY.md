# Script Reorganization Summary

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Change**: Organized shell scripts into `pi/` and `laptop/` subdirectories  
**Reason**: Crystal-clear separation of which scripts run where

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### **Before:**

```
scripts/
├── run_camera.sh
├── run_color_detection.sh
├── run_disease_detection.sh
├── run_full_processing.sh
└── README.md
```

**Problem**: Not immediately obvious which scripts belong to which machine.

---

### **After:**

```
scripts/
├── README.md
├── pi/                           # ← Raspberry Pi scripts
│   └── run_camera.sh
└── laptop/                       # ← Laptop scripts
    ├── run_color_detection.sh
    ├── run_disease_detection.sh
    └── run_full_processing.sh
```

**Benefit**: Instantly clear! Just navigate to `pi/` or `laptop/` folder.

## ✅ Changes Made

1. **Created Subdirectories**

   - Created `scripts/pi/`
   - Created `scripts/laptop/`

   - Moved `run_color_detection.sh` → `scripts/laptop/`
   - Moved `run_disease_detection.sh` → `scripts/laptop/`
   - Moved `run_full_processing.sh` → `scripts/laptop/`

3. **Updated setup.py**

   - Changed installation paths to include subdirectories
   - Scripts now install to `lib/rpi_camera_package/pi/` and `lib/rpi_camera_package/laptop/`

4. **Updated Documentation**

   - ✅ scripts/README.md - Added directory structure diagram, updated all paths
   - ✅ QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Updated script paths
   - ✅ QUICKSTART.md - Updated script paths

## 📍 New Usage

### **On Raspberry Pi:**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/rpi_camera_package/scripts/pi
./run_camera.sh
```

### **On Laptop:**

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/rpi_camera_package/scripts/laptop
./run_disease_detection.sh    # Or any other laptop script
```

## 🎨 Installation Structure

**After installation, scripts are located at:**

```
~/ros2_ws/install/rpi_camera_package/lib/rpi_camera_package/
├── pi/
│   └── run_camera.sh -> (symlink)
└── laptop/
    ├── run_color_detection.sh -> (symlink)
    ├── run_disease_detection.sh -> (symlink)
    └── run_full_processing.sh -> (symlink)
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **🎯 Clarity**: Immediately obvious which scripts are for which machine
2. **🚀 Simplicity**: Just navigate to the right folder
3. **📚 Organization**: Professional project structure
4. **👥 Beginner-Friendly**: No confusion about where to run scripts
5. **🔒 Safety**: Reduces chance of running wrong script on wrong machine
