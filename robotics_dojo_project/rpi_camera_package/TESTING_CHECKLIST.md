ros2 launch rpi_camera_package camera_compressed.launch.py pi jpeg_quality:=90
```

### Test Display Toggle (Color Detection)

```bash
# Laptop - disable display

```

- [ ] Still logs detections to terminal

### Test Min Area Adjustment (Color Detection)

```bash
# Laptop - smaller threshold
ros2 launch rpi_camera_package color_detection.launch.py laptop min_area:=500
```

- [ ] Detects smaller colored objects

### Test Inference Rate (Disease Detection)

```bash
# Laptop - different inference rates
ros2 launch rpi_camera_package disease_detection.launch.py laptop inference_rate:=0.5
ros2 launch rpi_camera_package disease_detection.launch.py laptop inference_rate:=2.0
```

- [ ] 0.5 Hz = inference every 2 seconds (lower CPU)
- [ ] 2.0 Hz = inference twice per second (higher CPU)

### Test Confidence Threshold (Disease Detection)

```bash
# Laptop - require 50% confidence minimum
ros2 launch rpi_camera_package disease_detection.launch.py laptop confidence_threshold:=0.5
```

- [ ] Only reports detections with >50% confidence

## üêõ Common Issues

### Camera Not Found

- [ ] Checked: Legacy camera enabled?
- [ ] Checked: Rebooted after enabling?
- [ ] Checked: Cable connected properly?
- [ ] Checked: `vcgencmd get_camera` shows detected=1?

### No Network Discovery

- [ ] Checked: Same ROS_DOMAIN_ID?
- [ ] Checked: ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=0?
- [ ] Checked: Firewall not blocking?
- [ ] Checked: Both on same subnet?
- [ ] Tried: `ros2 daemon stop && ros2 daemon start`?

### Low Frame Rate

- [ ] Using compressed launch file?
- [ ] Network quality good (WiFi 5GHz or Ethernet)?
- [ ] CPU usage normal (<50% on Pi)?

### Detection Not Working

- [ ] Images reaching laptop? `ros2 topic hz /camera/image_raw/compressed`
- [ ] Objects large enough? (>1000 pixels)
- [ ] Colors in detectable range?
- [ ] Good lighting?

### Disease Detection Issues

- [ ] PyTorch installed? `python3 -c "import torch"`
- [ ] Model file exists? `ls ~/ros2_ws/install/rpi_camera_package/share/rpi_camera_package/models/`
- [ ] Using potato leaves (not other plants)?
- [ ] Leaf fills 50-80% of frame?
- [ ] Consistent lighting?
