# merge_All Branch - Complete Integration Summary

**Branch:** `merge_All`  
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Purpose:** Unified branch combining sensor fusion fixes AND py_trees competition work

---

## 🎯 What's in This Branch?

The `merge_All` branch contains **BOTH** critical improvements from two separate development efforts:

### 1. **Sensor Fusion Fixes** (from `z_axix` branch)
### 2. **Py_trees Competition 2025** (from `making_pytrees_work_well` branch)

## 🔧 1. Sensor Fusion Fixes (from z_axix)

### **Critical Files Modified:**

#### **A. ros_arduino_bridge.py**
**Location:** `ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_bridge.py`

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **IMU degree-to-radian conversion** with proper sign handling
  - Arduino sends yaw in degrees: -180° to +180°
  - Converts to radians: -π to +π (preserves negative for left turns)
- ✅ **Velocity-only odometry** (no position integration)
  - Publishes linear/angular velocities ONLY
  - Lets EKF integrate position with IMU yaw
- ✅ **Motor command logging** for M4 debugging
- ✅ **IMU calibration** on startup (gyro bias removal)

**Fixed Issues:**
- Severe drift when stationary (1.4m position drift, 0.13 rad/s rotation)
- Double integration problem (encoders + EKF both integrating position)
- IMU yaw incorrect (degrees vs radians)

#### **B. ekf_config.yaml**
**Location:** `ros_arduino_bridge/config/ekf_config.yaml`

**Key Changes:**
- ✅ **Encoder configuration (odom0):**
  - Position: DISABLED ❌
  - Orientation: DISABLED ❌
  - Linear velocity: ENABLED ✅ [true, true, false]
  - Angular velocity: DISABLED ❌
  - Covariance: vx/vy = 0.1 (medium trust)

- ✅ **IMU configuration (imu0):**
  - Position: DISABLED ❌
  - Orientation: ONLY YAW ✅ [false, false, true]
  - Angular velocity: DISABLED ❌
  - Acceleration: DISABLED ❌
  - Covariance: yaw = 0.0005 (very low, trust DMP!)

- ✅ **Process noise:**
  - yaw: 0.001 (very low, IMU stable)
  - vyaw: 0.001 (low, IMU corrects)

**Why This Works:**
- Encoders provide drift-free velocity measurements
- IMU provides drift-free absolute yaw orientation
- EKF fuses both: encoder velocities + IMU yaw → accurate position

#### **C. Launch Files**
**Modified Files:**
- `launch/arduino_bridge.py` - Added `publish_tf: False` (CRITICAL!)
- `launch/slam_with_sensor_fusion.launch.py` - Configured for EKF
- `launch/test_teleop.launch.py` - `publish_tf: True` (no EKF, just testing)
- `launch/full_slam_test.launch.py` - `publish_tf: True` (no EKF, just SLAM)

**Key Fix:**
```python
# When using EKF sensor fusion:
'publish_tf': False  # Let EKF publish odom→base_link

# When NOT using EKF (simple tests):
'publish_tf': True   # Arduino bridge publishes odom→base_link
```

**Problem Solved:**
- TF conflict: Both arduino_bridge AND EKF were publishing `odom→base_link`
- Result: RViz wheels disappeared, map breaking during turns
- Solution: Only ONE node publishes each transform

#### **D. Documentation Added**
- `DOUBLE_INTEGRATION_FIX.md` - Explains velocity-only approach
- `SENSOR_FUSION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete EKF guide
- `YAW_DIFFERENTIATION_FIX.md` - Why IMU yaw better than gyro
- `DRIFT_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md` - Kalman filter guide

## 🔄 Integration Strategy

### **How We Combined Both:**

1. **Started with:** `first-pytrees` branch (behavior tree work)
2. **Merged:** `z_axix` branch (sensor fusion fixes) → Created `merge_All`
3. **Result:** 190 merge conflicts (unrelated histories)
4. **Resolution:**
   - Accepted `ours` (first-pytrees) for most files
   - Selectively took `theirs` (z_axix) for sensor fusion files
   - Result: Both improvements preserved!

5. **Added:** Latest py_trees work from `making_pytrees_work_well`
   - Used `git checkout making_pytrees_work_well -- ros_arduino_bridge/behavior_tree/`
   - Zero conflicts with sensor fusion files
   - Clean integration!

### **Files That Were Carefully Merged:**

**From z_axix (sensor fusion):**
- `ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_bridge.py`
- `ros_arduino_bridge/config/ekf_config.yaml`
- `ros_arduino_bridge/launch/arduino_bridge.py`
- `ros_arduino_bridge/launch/sensor_fusion.launch.py`
- `ros_arduino_bridge/launch/slam_with_sensor_fusion.launch.py`

**From making_pytrees_work_well (behavior tree):**
- `ros_arduino_bridge/behavior_tree/` (entire directory)
- 39 files added: competition code, nodes, docs, tests

**No conflicts:** Sensor fusion files and behavior tree files are completely separate!
