# Double Integration Fix - Eliminating EKF Drift

## Problem Discovery

**Symptom**: Robot drift/spinning in `/odometry/filtered` even when lifted off ground with wheels spinning freely.

**Key Finding**: Drift occurs even without ground contact/slip, proving it's NOT a sensor noise issue but a **computation/integration error**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Double Integration Problem

We were doing **integration twice**, causing conflicting pose estimates:

1. **First Integration** (in `ros_arduino_bridge.py`):
   ```python
   self.odom_theta += angular_displacement  # Line 943
   self.odom_x += linear_displacement * math.cos(self.odom_theta)
   self.odom_y += linear_displacement * math.sin(self.odom_theta)
   ```
   - Raw odometry node accumulates position using encoder-based theta
   - This integrated pose is published in `/odom` topic

2. **Second Integration** (in robot_localization EKF):
   - EKF reads the already-integrated position from `/odom`
   - EKF also reads absolute orientation from `/imu/data`
   - EKF tries to fuse these two conflicting sources
   - **Conflict**: Encoder theta ≠ IMU yaw (encoders slip, IMU drifts)

### Why This Causes Drift

```
Raw Odometry: position = ∫(velocity · cos(encoder_theta)) dt
EKF Fusion:   position = ∫(velocity · cos(IMU_yaw)) dt

When encoder_theta ≠ IMU_yaw → position estimates diverge → DRIFT!
```

The EKF can't reconcile:
- Position calculated using encoder_theta (from raw odometry)
- Orientation from IMU_yaw (absolute reference)

This mismatch accumulates over time, causing the robot to appear to drift/spin even when stationary.

## The Solution

### Velocity-Only Integration

**Key Principle**: Let the EKF be the **single source of truth** for position integration.

**Implementation**:

1. **Raw Odometry** (`ros_arduino_bridge.py`):
   - Still calculates position internally (for raw `/odom` visualization)
   - But publishes **velocities only** to EKF
   - Position/orientation in `/odom` is ignored by EKF

2. **EKF Configuration** (`ekf_config.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   odom0_config: [
       false, false, false,  # x, y, z position - DISABLED
       false, false, false,  # roll, pitch, yaw - DISABLED
       true,  true,  false,  # x_vel, y_vel, z_vel - ENABLED
       false, false, true,   # angular velocities - yaw_vel ENABLED
       false, false, false,  # accelerations - DISABLED
   ]
   ```

3. **EKF Integration**:
   - Reads linear velocities (vx, vy) from encoders
   - Reads angular velocity (yaw_vel) from encoders
   - Reads absolute orientation (yaw) from IMU
   - Integrates: `position = ∫(velocity · cos(IMU_yaw)) dt`
   - **Single integration** using consistent orientation source!

### Data Flow

```
Encoders → Linear Velocity (vx, vy)  ──┐
Encoders → Angular Velocity (yaw_vel) ─┤
                                        ├──→ EKF → Filtered Pose (position + orientation)
IMU DMP → Absolute Orientation (yaw) ──┘
```

**No more conflicts!** The EKF integrates velocities using IMU orientation as the absolute reference.

## Why This Works

### No Double Integration
- Raw odometry provides **instantaneous velocities** only
- EKF performs **single integration** of these velocities
- No conflicting pose estimates to reconcile

### Best of Both Sensors
- **Encoder velocities**: Accurate, no slip when wheels spin freely, drift-free angular velocity
- **IMU orientation**: Absolute reference, corrects accumulated integration errors
- **EKF fusion**: Integrates encoder motion with IMU heading for optimal pose estimate

### Drift-Free Characteristics
- **Encoder angular velocity**: Mechanical constraint, no drift (left_speed ≠ right_speed)
- **IMU DMP yaw**: Sensor fusion, very stable, minimal drift
- **EKF integration**: Single pass, no conflicting sources, no accumulation

## Testing

### Validation Test (Lifted Robot)
1. Lift robot off ground (no wheel slip possible)
2. Send rotation command
3. Observe `/odometry/filtered` in RViz
4. **Expected**: Robot rotates in place, no position drift
5. **Before fix**: Position drifted significantly (1.4m)
6. **After fix**: No drift (velocities integrated with stable IMU yaw)

### Ground Test
1. Place robot on ground
2. Send rotation command
3. **Expected**: Even with wheel slip, IMU corrects for true rotation
4. EKF fuses:
   - Encoder velocities (may have slip errors)
   - IMU yaw (absolute truth)
   - Result: Accurate pose despite slip

## Key Changes

### File: `ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_bridge/ros_arduino_bridge.py`
- **Lines 937-951**: Added clarifying comments
- Position integration kept for raw `/odom` visualization
- EKF now ignores this position, uses velocities only

### File: `ros_arduino_bridge/config/ekf_config.yaml`
- **Lines 33-35**: Disabled position from wheel odometry
- **Lines 36-38**: Disabled orientation from wheel odometry (already was)
- **Lines 39-41**: Enabled velocities (linear + angular)
- **Result**: EKF uses only velocities from encoders, orientation from IMU

## Technical Details

### Why Not Use Differential Mode?
- `odom0_differential: false` is correct
- Velocities are **inherently differential** (rate of change)
- Differential mode is for pose differences, not velocities
- Our velocities are instantaneous measurements, not pose deltas

### Covariance Tuning
```yaml
# Encoder velocities - trusted for motion
odom0: [0.01, 0.01, 0.01, ...]  # vx, vy covariance

# Encoder angular velocity - very reliable
odom0: [..., 0.1]  # yaw_vel covariance

# IMU orientation - DMP is excellent
imu0: [0.001, 0.001, 0.002]  # roll, pitch, yaw covariance
```

Low covariances = high trust. EKF weights these measurements heavily.

## Summary

**Before**: Double integration with conflicting orientation sources → drift  
**After**: Single integration with velocity-only encoder input + IMU orientation → no drift

**The Fix**: Disabled position/orientation in `odom0_config`, letting EKF integrate velocities with IMU yaw as the single source of truth for orientation.
