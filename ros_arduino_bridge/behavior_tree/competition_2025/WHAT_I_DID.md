## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Based on Your Working Reference Code

I used the code you provided as inspiration! It had:

- ✅ Shared AMCL pose subscription (singleton)
- ✅ Proper Nav2 async callbacks
- ✅ Goal tolerance configuration
- ✅ Real-time distance monitoring

### 2. Added Detailed Direction Comments

Every navigation behavior now explains:

- **WHAT** direction it moves
- **HOW** it determines direction
- **WHERE** the direction info comes from

### 3. Clean Organization

- Separate folder for competition code
- Doesn't mix with your old experimental files
- Easy to find everything

## 🧭 HOW MOVEMENT WORKS (Answered!)

### Direction Sources:

1. **AMCL** (`/amcl_pose` topic):

   - Tells robot WHERE it is on map (x, y, yaw)
   - Updates continuously
   - Shared across all MoveToPosition instances

2. **Nav2** (navigation stack):

   - Plans path from current → goal
   - Considers obstacles from LiDAR costmap
   - Executes path with DWB controller
   - Re-plans if obstacles appear

3. **Map Frame** (coordinate system):
   ```
       ↑ Y (North)
       |
       └──→ X (East)
   ```
   - Origin at (0, 0) = robot start
   - All waypoints use these coordinates

### Example:

```python
MoveToPosition("GoHere", 2.0, 1.5)
```

- Go to map position (2.0, 1.5)
- Nav2 plans optimal path
- Avoids obstacles dynamically
- Uses AMCL for current position

## 📁 Files to Use

### Run Competition Mission:

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/ros_arduino_bridge/behavior_tree/competition_2025
python3 competition_mission.py
```

### Read Documentation:

- `README.md` - Full guide
- `behaviors/navigation.py` - See detailed movement comments

### Import Behaviors:

```python
from behaviors import MoveToPosition, ReadColorSensor, ...
```

## 🔍 Where I Got Directions From

### In Your Reference Code:

1. **Line 74-82**: `shared_pose_callback()` - Gets pose from AMCL
2. **Line 126-137**: Sends goal to Nav2 action server
3. **Line 150-156**: Monitors distance to goal
4. **Line 37-39**: `make_pose()` - Creates goal in map frame

### How It Works:

1. AMCL publishes robot pose → `shared_pose_callback()` updates class variables
2. `MoveToPosition.update()` reads current pose from class variables
3. Creates goal pose in map frame → Sends to Nav2
4. Nav2 plans path → Executes with obstacle avoidance
5. Monitors distance until goal reached

## 🎁 What You Get

### 1. Organized Competition Code

- Clean separate folder
- Won't interfere with old code
- Easy to understand

### 2. Detailed Documentation

- Every behavior explains direction/movement
- README with full guide
- Comments based on your working code

### 3. Ready to Run

- Import: `from behaviors import MoveToPosition`
- Run: `python3 competition_mission.py`
- Test: Use existing `test_waypoints.py`

## ⏭️ Next Steps

1. **Verify waypoints** - Use RViz to check coordinates
2. **Test mission** - Run `competition_mission.py`
3. **Adjust as needed** - Update waypoints in mission file

**Everything is in**: `behavior_tree/competition_2025/`

**Your old code**: Still in `behavior_tree/` (untouched)
