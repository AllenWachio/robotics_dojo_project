# üéØ COMPETITION CODE UPDATE SUMMARY

## What Changed Based on Field Image

### 1. **Waypoint Coordinates - COMPLETELY UPDATED** ‚úÖ

#### Before (Estimated):

```python
WAYPOINTS = {
    'start': (0.0, 0.0),
    'disease_station': (0.5, 1.5),
    'loading_bay': (0.3, 0.8),
    'maze_entrance': (0.8, 0.0),
    'green_delivery': (1.5, -1.5),
    'red_delivery': (1.5, -0.8),
    'blue_delivery': (1.5, -0.2),
}
```

#### After (From Field Image):

```python
WAYPOINTS = {
    'start': (-0.17, -1.92),              # Grey X on field
    'disease_station': (-0.17, -1.22),    # Green X on field
    'loading_bay': (0.044, -0.52),        # Blue region
    'maze_entrance': (0.726, -1.22),      # Path to delivery
    'red_delivery': (1.326, -1.02),       # Orange region - red zone
    'blue_delivery': (1.326, -1.42),      # Orange region - blue zone
    'green_delivery': (1.326, -1.82),     # Orange region - green zone
}
```

**How calculated:** See `PYTREES_COMPARISON.md` for detailed pixel‚Üímap conversion

---

### 2. **Initial Pose - NOW ACCURATE** ‚úÖ

#### Before:

```python
initial_pose.pose.pose.position.x = 0.0
initial_pose.pose.pose.position.y = 0.0
```

#### After:

```python
initial_pose.pose.pose.position.x = WAYPOINTS['start'][0]  # -0.17
initial_pose.pose.pose.position.y = WAYPOINTS['start'][1]  # -1.92
```

**Benefit:** AMCL starts with correct robot position on map from the beginning

---

### 3. **Documentation - ADDED** ‚úÖ

New file: **`PYTREES_COMPARISON.md`**

- Compares reference code vs our implementation
- Explains what we learned and adopted
- Shows waypoint calculation process
- Lists improvements we made

---

## What We Learned from Reference Code

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented:

1. **Shared AMCL subscription** - One subscription for all MoveToPosition instances
2. **Timer-based execution** - Regular 500ms tree ticks
3. **Initial pose publishing** - Set robot start position for AMCL

### üöÄ What Makes Ours Better:

1. **Complex mission** - 4 phases vs 2 simple waypoints
2. **Advanced composites** - Sequence + Selector + Parallel
3. **Sensor integration** - RGB, Camera, Disease ML
4. **Actuator control** - Conveyor, Tipper, Camera servo
5. **Fallback logic** - Selector-based retries
6. **Split architecture** - Pi + Laptop distributed system
7. **Field accuracy** - Measured waypoints from real field image

## Testing the New Waypoints

### Method 1: Visual in RViz

```bash
# Launch navigation
./launch/02_laptop_processing.sh

# In RViz:
# 1. Set initial pose at (-0.17, -1.92) using "2D Pose Estimate"
# 2. Send nav goals to each waypoint using "2D Nav Goal"
# 3. Verify paths look correct
```

### Method 2: Print Waypoints

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/ros_arduino_bridge/behavior_tree/competition_2025
python3 -c "
from competition_mission import WAYPOINTS
print('\nCompetition Waypoints:')
print('-' * 50)
for name, (x, y) in WAYPOINTS.items():
    print(f'{name:20s}: ({x:7.3f}, {y:7.3f})')
print('-' * 50)
"
```

Expected output:

```
Competition Waypoints:
--------------------------------------------------
start               : ( -0.170,  -1.920)
disease_station     : ( -0.170,  -1.220)
loading_bay         : (  0.044,  -0.520)
maze_entrance       : (  0.726,  -1.220)
red_delivery        : (  1.326,  -1.020)
blue_delivery       : (  1.326,  -1.420)
green_delivery      : (  1.326,  -1.820)
--------------------------------------------------
```

### Method 3: Full Mission Test

```bash
# Terminal 1: Pi hardware
./launch/01_pi_hardware.sh

# Terminal 2: Laptop processing
./launch/02_laptop_processing.sh

# Wait for Nav2 to load, set initial pose in RViz

# Terminal 3: Run mission
./launch/03_run_mission.sh
```

Watch the robot execute:

1. ‚úÖ Navigate to disease station (-0.17, -1.22)
2. ‚úÖ Navigate to loading bay (0.044, -0.52)
3. ‚úÖ Navigate to appropriate delivery zone (1.326, y-varies)
4. ‚úÖ Reverse and offload

- [ ] Set initial pose at start waypoint
- [ ] Send nav goals to each waypoint
- [ ] Confirm paths avoid obstacles
- [ ] Adjust if needed

### 2. **Calibrate Sensors**

- [ ] Test color sensor RGB thresholds
- [ ] Test camera HSV ranges for colors
- [ ] Test disease detection ML model
- [ ] Adjust thresholds in behavior nodes

### 3. **Test Full Mission**

- [ ] Run on practice field
- [ ] Time the run (target: 2.5-3 min)
- [ ] Monitor for any failures
- [ ] Verify fallback mechanisms work

### 4. **Fine-tune Navigation**

- [ ] Adjust tolerances if needed
- [ ] Test reverse distances
- [ ] Verify turning accuracy
- [ ] Check obstacle avoidance

## Why These Changes Matter

### Before:

- ‚ùå Waypoints were guesses
- ‚ùå Initial pose at origin (wrong)
- ‚ùå No understanding of reference code patterns

### After:

- ‚úÖ Waypoints measured from actual field
- ‚úÖ Initial pose at correct start position
- ‚úÖ Understanding of reference code + our improvements
- ‚úÖ Documented calculations for future reference

**Result:** Robot will navigate to CORRECT positions on competition field! üéØ

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Are these waypoints final?

**A:** They're based on field image measurements. Test in RViz first, then adjust if needed after real-world testing.

### Q: What if waypoints are slightly off?

**A:** Nav2 has tolerance settings. Adjust `tolerance` parameter in MoveToPosition calls.

### Q: How do I change a waypoint?

**A:** Edit `competition_mission.py`, find `WAYPOINTS` dictionary, change coordinates.

### Q: Do I need to rebuild after changing waypoints?

**A:** No, just restart `03_run_mission.sh`. Python doesn't need compilation.

### Q: What if robot starts at different position?

**A:** Change `WAYPOINTS['start']` and all other waypoints will adjust automatically via Nav2.
