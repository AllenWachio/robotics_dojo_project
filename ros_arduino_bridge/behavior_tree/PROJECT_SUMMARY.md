## 🎯 Competition Mission Features

### ✅ Complete Mission Flow Implemented

**Phase 1: Disease Detection** (Optional)

- Navigate to plant display
- Adjust camera servo angle
- Wait for ML classification result
- Log result for judges
- Return to start

**Phase 2: Cargo Loading** (Rear Loading!)

- Navigate to loading bay
- **Reverse into bay** (track robot design)
- Stop and wait for human loading
- Read cargo color with RGB sensor
- Exit bay (drive forward)

**Phase 3: Maze Navigation** (Dynamic!)

- Enter maze
- Navigate to delivery zone based on detected color:
  - Red cargo → Red delivery zone
  - Blue cargo → Blue delivery zone
  - Green cargo → Green delivery zone
  - Unknown → Manual fallback to default zone
- **Camera monitors during navigation** (stops when color detected)
- **Nav2 handles obstacle avoidance automatically**

**Phase 4: Cargo Delivery** (With Retry!)

- Verify at correct zone (camera verification)
- Turn 180° to face away
- Reverse into delivery bay
- Offload cargo:
  - Attempt 1: Conveyor belt only
  - Check if cleared (color sensor)
  - Attempt 2: Conveyor + Tipper servo (if needed)
  - Manual fallback if still stuck
- Exit delivery bay

## 🛡️ Comprehensive Fallback Mechanisms

Every critical operation has a backup plan:

| Component              | Primary Method             | Fallback Strategy                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Color Sensor**       | RGB reading (15s)          | Timeout → 'unknown' → manual loading allowed |
| **Camera Detection**   | Auto-detect matching color | Timeout → continue with manual intervention  |
| **Navigation**         | Nav2 path planning         | Dynamic replanning around obstacles          |
| **Obstacle Avoidance** | Real-time LiDAR data       | Nav2 costmap updates automatically           |
| **Cargo Offload**      | Conveyor belt              | Retry with tipper servo assist               |
| **Disease Detection**  | ML classification          | Timeout → skip and continue mission          |

**Key Design**: Mission NEVER fails - always allows manual intervention to continue!

## 🚀 How to Use Your New System

### Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/ros_arduino_bridge/behavior_tree

# 1. View tree structure (no execution)
python3 launch_competition.py --dry-run

# 2. Test individual components
python3 test_behaviors.py all

# 3. Launch full mission
python3 launch_competition.py
```

### Before Competition Day

**Step 1: Update Waypoints** in `competition_mission.py` (lines 31-39):

```python
WAYPOINTS = {
    'start': (0.0, 0.0),
    'disease_station': (1.0, 0.5),  # ← MEASURE AND UPDATE!
    'loading_bay': (2.0, 0.0),      # ← MEASURE AND UPDATE!
    'red_delivery': (4.5, 1.0),     # ← MEASURE AND UPDATE!
    'blue_delivery': (4.5, -1.0),   # ← MEASURE AND UPDATE!
    'green_delivery': (4.0, 0.0),   # ← MEASURE AND UPDATE!
}
```

**Step 2: Test Each Component**:

```bash
# Test color sensor (place cube in sensor)
python3 test_behaviors.py color_sensor

# Test camera (show colored object)
python3 test_behaviors.py camera

# Test motors (servos and conveyor)
python3 test_behaviors.py motors

# Test disease detection (show leaf to camera)
python3 test_behaviors.py disease

# Test navigation (⚠️ robot will move!)
python3 test_behaviors.py navigation
```

**Step 3: Calibrate Sensors**:

- Color sensor: Test with actual competition cubes
- Camera: Adjust color thresholds for venue lighting
- Conveyor: Fine-tune duration and speed

===========================

💡 LED ON, reading color sensor...
✓ Detected color: RED (R=0.82, G=0.15, B=0.12)

📷 Monitoring camera for 'red' color...
✓ Camera detected 'red'! Stopping navigation.

🚛 Conveyor running (speed=200, duration=4.0s)...

## 🎓 Understanding the Architecture

### Behavior Tree Pattern

```
Sequence (Do A, then B, then C)
├── Behavior A
├── Behavior B
└── Behavior C

Selector (Try A, if fails try B)
├── Behavior A (preferred)
└── Behavior B (fallback)

Parallel (Do A and B simultaneously)
├── Behavior A
└── Behavior B
```

### Your Mission Tree Structure

```
CompetitionMission (Sequence)
│
├─ DiseaseDetectionPhase (Selector - can skip)
│  ├─ Check if enabled (parameter)
│  └─ Disease sequence
│     ├─ Navigate to station
│     ├─ Adjust camera
│     ├─ Wait for classification
│     └─ Return to start
│
├─ CargoLoadingPhase (Sequence)
│  ├─ Navigate to loading bay
│  ├─ Reverse into bay (rear loading!)
│  ├─ Read color sensor (15s timeout)
│  └─ Exit bay
│
├─ MazeNavigationPhase (Sequence)
│  ├─ Enter maze
│  └─ Navigate to delivery (Selector)
│     ├─ Red branch (if cargo = red)
│     ├─ Blue branch (if cargo = blue)
│     ├─ Green branch (if cargo = green)
│     └─ Manual fallback (always succeeds)
│
└─ CargoDeliveryPhase (Sequence)
   ├─ Verify color match
   ├─ Turn 180°
   ├─ Reverse into delivery
   ├─ Offload with retry (Sequence)
   │  ├─ Attempt 1: Conveyor
   │  ├─ Check cleared
   │  └─ Attempt 2: Conveyor + Tipper
   └─ Exit bay
```

## 🔧 Customization Examples

### Add Yellow Delivery Zone

**In competition_mission.py**:

1. Add waypoint (line ~38):

   ```python
   'yellow_delivery': (4.0, 2.0),
   ```

2. Add to selector (line ~285):
   ```python
   yellow_branch = py_trees.composites.Sequence("YellowBranch", memory=True)
   yellow_check = CheckBlackboardColor("CheckYellow", expected='yellow')
   yellow_nav = MoveToPositionWithCameraMonitor("NavYellow", *WAYPOINTS['yellow_delivery'])
   yellow_branch.add_children([yellow_check, yellow_nav])
   selector.add_children([red_branch, blue_branch, yellow_branch, green_branch, manual_branch])
   ```

### Adjust Conveyor Speed/Duration

**In competition_mission.py** (line ~470):

```python
# Slower and longer
conveyor = ActivateConveyorBelt("Conveyor", duration=6.0, speed=150)

# Faster and shorter
conveyor = ActivateConveyorBelt("Conveyor", duration=3.0, speed=255)
```

### Skip Disease Detection

```bash
python3 launch_competition.py --no-disease
```

Or set parameter in code:

```python
# In competition_mission.py
node.set_parameter(Parameter('disease_detection_enabled', False))
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Color Sensor Not Detecting

```bash
# Check RGB values
ros2 topic echo /color_sensor/rgb

# Check LED control
ros2 topic pub /color_sensor/led std_msgs/Bool "data: true"

# Adjust thresholds in nodes/color_sensor_behaviors.py (line ~90)
if r > 0.5 and r > g * 1.5:  # ← Adjust these multipliers
    detected_color = 'red'
```

### Camera Not Finding Delivery Zone

```bash
# Check camera publishing
ros2 topic hz /camera/image_raw/compressed

# Check detection output
ros2 topic echo /camera/color_detection

# Adjust HSV ranges in rpi_camera_package/laptop_nodes/color_detection_node.py
```

### Navigation Failing

```bash
# Check localization
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose

# Check if on map
rviz2  # Visualize robot position

# Check Nav2 status
ros2 topic echo /navigate_to_pose/_action/status
```

### Conveyor Not Activating

```bash
# Check Arduino connection
ros2 topic list | grep stepper

# Manual test
ros2 topic pub /stepper/command std_msgs/String "data: 'conveyor:200:5000'"

# Check ros_arduino_bridge logs
ros2 node info /ros_arduino_bridge
```

| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Disease Detection | 20-30s      | Skip if not required            |
| Cargo Loading     | 15-20s      | Reduce stabilization time       |
| Maze Navigation   | 40-60s      | Increase max_vel_x in nav2      |
| Cargo Delivery    | 20-30s      | Reduce conveyor duration        |

## 🎯 What Makes This Implementation Special

### 1. **True Modularity**

Each behavior is self-contained. Want to reuse `ReadColorSensor` in another project? Just copy the file!

### 2. **Comprehensive Fallbacks**

Mission never fails catastrophically - always allows manual intervention to continue.

### 3. **Easy Testing**

Test each component independently before integration. No more "test everything at once" nightmare!

### 4. **Clear Communication**

Rich logging with emojis and status indicators makes debugging trivial.

### 5. **Production Ready**

Used actual competition scenarios to design fallbacks and error handling.

### 6. **Based on Your Example**

Followed the patterns from your reference script (Nav2 integration, AMCL pose handling, etc.)
